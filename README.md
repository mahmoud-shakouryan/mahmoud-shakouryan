I'm Mahmoud from Iran, and I develop web applications. I'm relly into learning languages and frameworks like react.js and node.js, as well as databases like mongodb. I'm also starving to be that deep in these topics that there would be as few as possible developers like me. you can check my twitter at www.twitter.com/mahmoud_1886 or https://www.linkedin.com/in/mahmoudshakouryan.

Skills: JS / REACT / NODE
